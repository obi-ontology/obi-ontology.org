# obi-ontology.org

This is a first draft of a new website for the Ontology for Biomedical Investigations. It will contain an overview and documentation for the project. We want to replace the current MediaWiki site as soon as possible with a minimal new OBI website, then build from there.

This site is build using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com). Help with the content (and styling!) is appreciated.

A preview of this new site is avaiable: <https://obi-ontology.github.io/obi-ontology.org>.
